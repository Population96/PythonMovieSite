To build page: 
open entertainment_center.py and run in python environment.  Web page will automatically open.

If a python environment is not available, the included alexs_movies.html is the latest generated web page from the script.

The script entertainment_center.py relies on the media.py for the Movie class, and make_page.py to generate the webpage.  The .pyc extention files are the compiled versions of their .py counterparts. 

Modifications:

modified the page title and html title attribute
added some color to the background
round the movie tile edges with CSS3
included color matched dropshadows to the tiles
added storyline text as tooltip text when hovering the mouse over the movie posters
included the year in the class definition to display under the title
